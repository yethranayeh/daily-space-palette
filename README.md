# Daily Space Palette

<p align="center"><img src="public/icons/apple-touch-icon.png" /></p>

This is a web app that fetches the Astronomy Picture of the Day using [NASA's APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/?ref=public-apis#browseAPI), then generates a color palette from that picture.

With this project, I hope to offer designers and developers an automatically generated color palette that contains colors from the Astronomy Picture of the Day.

## Areas for Improvement

- Derivative color palettes based on original picture theme
- Displaying previous pictures (last week, this month, etc.)
  - switching theme when in specific picture page
- User login
  - saving favorites
